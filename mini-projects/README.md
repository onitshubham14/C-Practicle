# Banking Interest Calculation – C Mini Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project simulates a basic **banking interest calculation system** using the C programming language.  
It calculates the **final account balance** by applying **yearly compound interest** to a principal amount over a specified number of years.

The project helps beginners understand how loops and arithmetic operations work in real-world financial calculations.

## 🎯 Objective
The main aim of this project is to:
- Take user input for principal amount, rate of interest, and time (years)
- Calculate interest **year by year**
- Update the balance after each year
- Display the **final balance** at the end

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** C
- **Concepts:**  
  - Variables  
  - Loops (`for`)  
  - Arithmetic operations  
  - `scanf()` and `printf()`

---

## 📋 Program Logic (Steps)
1. Ask the user to enter:
   - Principal amount  
   - Rate of interest  
   - Number of years  
2. Read the inputs using `scanf()`
3. Store the principal as the initial balance
4. Run a loop for each year
5. Calculate yearly interest
6. Add interest to the balance
7. Update the balance after every year
8. Continue until all years are completed
9. Store the final balance
10. Print the final balance
